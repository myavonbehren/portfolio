## Design Process

Used **Figma** to design the desktop and mobile version. Set up Figma variables for Typography and Color Palettes (thanks to this [guide](https://uxdesign.cc/set-up-typography-variables-in-figma-359cfea88b68#9f48)). Used components to reuse components across pages including the burger bar, segemented control. Learned how to animate components (specifically segmented control animation thanks to

developed the hero section, navbar. 

needed a segmented control, so i read an article and downloaed the framer motion library. 

next was filling out the experience section. instead of hardcoding it, i decided to setup a database so that in the future i could edit the data easily without having to go into the codebase. intialized seed data within
